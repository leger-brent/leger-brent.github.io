        <p>This circle uses the linear transition from last project, but it has been upgraded not to snap back to the
            start position. This time it starts onLoad and then toggles back at the end. It uses touch event, so after
            the original transition, the only way to toggle the transition again is with a touch device.</p>
        <div id="linear" class="circle"></div>

        <p>This box registers onclick events and wil give you the position of your x and y coordinates of where the
            event happened on the page.</p>
        <div id="mouse">
            Click in this box.
            <div id="mouseClick"></div>
        </div>

        <p>Let's look at our square-to-circle animation from last project. It was already event driven, so most of the
            work has already been done. It starts automatically thanks to onLoad. This time though, instead of on
            mouseover and mouseoff, I set it up using a touch event. Like the circle above, the only way to trigger the
            event is with a touch device.</p>
        <div style="height: 300px;margin: 20px auto">
            <div id="square" class="square-to-circle"></div>
