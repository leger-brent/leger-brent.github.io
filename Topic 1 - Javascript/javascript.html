    <h2>Variables</h2>
    Variables are essentially "buckets" that can hold data. That data can be content like strings or numbers. In the
    following
    code snippet, I create 3 variables using the let keyword to hold strings, which in this case are the names of three
    heroes.
    <pre>
    let hero1 = "Vahn",
        hero2 = "Noa",
        hero3 = "Gala";
    </pre>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    Loops are a way to perform repetitive tasks over. The loop will start by checking against some condition, and when
    that condition is true, the loop will stop.
    Until the condition is met, the loop will continue to run.<br><br>
    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    Conditional Statements use operators to check data values against some expressed value. It allows different rules to
    run depending on the value of the data being checked.<br><br>

    In the following code snippet, I create a variable that will collect one of the strings I created above depending on
    the number of times I've completed the loop. Just before each loop finishes, I print the name of the hero. My
    variable i tracks the numbers through the loop. I've set it to conclude after 3 runs, which matches the number of
    hero names I have. We'll open the console where I print the results at the end of all the code examples.

    <pre>
    let k;

      for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (i === 0) {
          k = hero1;
        } else if (i === 1) {
          k = hero2;
        } else {
          k = hero3;
        }
        console.log("The name of this hero is " + k + ".");
      }
    </pre>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    Arrays are like variables but ones that can hold multiple values. Arrays are indexed and can be referenced by
    appending a bracket at the end of the variable name with the index number inside the bracket.<br><br>
    In this example, I create an array called "hero" and then add three more names to it in the form of strings. I also
    print the results to the console.

    <pre>
    let hero = ["Meta", "Terra", "Ozma"];

    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      console.log("The name of this hero is " + hero[i] + ".");
    }
    </pre>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    Functions are contained snippets of code that perform a specific action. Many functions are created for you already,
    but you can also create your own<br><br>

    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    Parameters are values that you can input into functions to manipulate or perform calculations on.<br><br>

    In the following code, I use the dot notation to call a function on the array I created earlier. ".push()" is a
    function that allows me to add more values to my already existing array. Inside the parenthesis, I enter my values
    and separate them by commas.

    <pre>
    hero.push("Vahn", "Noa", "Gala");
    </pre>

    Here I create a custom function called howMany. It accepts an array as a parameter and returns the number of values
    that are in it. I'll pass my hero array to it and print out how many values there are to the console.

    <pre>
    function howMany(array) {
      return array.length;
    }

    i = howMany(hero);

    console.log("There are " + i + " elements in the Hero Array.");
    </pre>

    <h2>Associative Arrays</h2>
    Associative Arrays are not supported in JavaScript. Technically they are a Key:Value pair, but an array or an object
    will be better used than these.

    In my example, I create the associate array. My keys are the on the left side of the colon while the value is on the
    right. Like all of my other examples on this page, I print the results to the console.
    <pre>
    var heroes = {
      one: "Vahn",
      two: "Noa",
      three: "Gala"
    };

    for (var key in heroes) {
      console.log("Hero " + key + " is named " + heroes[key] + ".");
    }
    </pre>

    <h2>Viewing the Output</h2>
    Now that we've run through all the code, press F12 to open the developer tools. Make sure you're on the "Console"
    tab and you should see the following output from the JavaScript that was run on your browser when the page loaded.
    <pre>
    The name of this hero is Vahn.
    The name of this hero is Noa.
    The name of this hero is Gala.

    The name of this hero is Meta.
    The name of this hero is Terra.
    The name of this hero is Ozma.

    There are 6 elements in the Hero Array.

    Hero one is named Vahn.
    Hero two is named Noa.
    Hero three is named Gala.
