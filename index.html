<h2>Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays</h2>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
The JavaScript can't be seen on this page. It all prints to the console. The explanation is for Chrome web browser.
    <ol>
        <li> Right click on this page and click "View page source." This will open new tab with the JavaScript.</li>
        <li> Under the script tag, you can find the Javascript. I've commented out each step.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> First I start with some variables, then I run through a loop containing a conditional statement and print the results to console. Next I create an array and a function and perform some modifications to the array before printing it to the console.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Once you take a look at the JavaScript, close the tab and come back here to this web page.</li>
        <li> Right click on this page again and click "Inspect." This will open the console.</li>
        <li> Click on the console tab to see the output that was printed to the console.</li>
